#Welcome to the fun Calculator!
#We're going to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers like a boss!

# Step 1: Ask the user to input the first number
# We're using 'float()' to amke sure our numbers can have decimals too. Fancy, right?
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))

# Step 2: Ask the user to input the second number
# Same trick here-using 'float()' for decimal magic!
num2 = float(input("Enter the Second number: "))

# Step 3: Time to do some math! Let's compute the sum, difference, product, and quotient.

# Add the two numbers (yay! Addition is the first step to fun!)
sum_result = num1 + num2

# Subtract the second number from the first (Negative Vibes but necessary!)
difference_result = num1 - num2

# Multiply the two numbers (More bang for your buck!)
product_result = num1 * num2

# Divide the first number by the second (be careful with zero here, no math disasters!)
# We'll assume the user is being responsible and not dividing by zero for now!
quotient_result = num1 / num2

# Step 4: Show the user what we got! Time for the big reveal!
print(f"Results of your two numbers: ")
print(f"Sum: {sum_result}")
print(f"Difference: {difference_result}")
print(f"Product: {product_result}")
print(f"Quotient: {quotient_result}")

# And that's It! You've just made a mini-calculator
